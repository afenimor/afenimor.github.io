To whomever this may concern,
My Twine narrative was written in second person style and is a “follow your interest” short story in which you take on one of the roles of a courts men/court lady under reign of King Henry. Throughout this adventure the player (you) may choose from broad categories of the types of people who would have lived in or around King Henry VIII and would have assisted him with his many duties. Essentially, as you, the player, travels through the narrative, you will be narrowed down into one of the important historical figures that is representative of whatever role you’ve taken on. The point of my Twine narrative is to bring to light the ways in which certain individuals became entangled with King Henry VIII in order to show how different people became politically tied to the Tudor Monarch. Throughout history, many kings and other dynastic rulers have been assisted by many different figures, but what makes the Tudor Monarch special is the specific use of these traditional roles for Henry VIII’s unique purposes. The utility of my Twine story is that is puts very important historical figures into more easily memoizable categories, and at the same time opens up conversation about gender and class by naming people by these broader pedagogical categories.
